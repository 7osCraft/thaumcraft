* Issues regarding MCPC+ are not accepted;
* Issues regarding running Thaumcraft in a developer environment are not accepted, this is not TC addon development hotline;

* Post the FML log (if there's a crash) on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or any other pastebin;
* Refer what mods you are running, if the game didn't crash;
* Make sure NEI block highlights are off if thaumcraft things are disappearing/changing into something else while looking at them;
* You don't need to prefix or suffix your issue titles with [Bug] or [Idea] or anything in square brackets, put the info inside the issue text, if anything needs to be flagged, we take care of it.
* Make sure your title is a good resume of the issue, "Research bug" or "Entity crash" are not good titles, for one.
* Don't edit en_US.lang
* Read the FaQ in the [TC thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2011841-).
